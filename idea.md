MAD Project Idea

Smart Flashcards for Fun & Easy Language Learning

Problem Statement
Learning a new language can be exciting, but it’s also frustrating when you keep forgetting the words you just learned. Most people either rely on boring vocabulary lists or repeat the same words without a proper system, which wastes time and kills motivation. On top of that, pronunciation often gets ignored, making it harder to speak confidently. I want to solve this by creating a tool that makes learning new words easier, more effective, and way more fun.
Proposed Solution / Idea
I’m building a mobile app that uses flashcards to help people remember words better. It won’t just show words randomly — it will use spaced repetition to bring back tricky words just when you’re about to forget them. The app will also include pictures, audio, and pronunciation feedback, so you’re learning with your eyes, ears, and voice. To keep it interesting, there will be streaks, quizzes, and rewards so learning feels like a game, not homework.
Key Features
1.) Make your own decks for different topics or languages.

2.) Spaced repetition system that focuses on words you struggle with.

3.) Audio and image support for each word to boost memory.

4.) Pronunciation practice with speech recognition.

5.) Streaks, badges, and progress tracking to keep motivation high.
Target Users / Audience
Anyone who wants to learn a new language — students, travelers, language hobbyists, or professionals preparing for an exam or moving abroad.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React Native (cross-platform for Android & iOS)
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MySQL
APIs: Google Translate, Text-to-Speech, and Speech-to-Text
Expected Outcome
A fun, easy-to-use app that actually helps people remember new vocabulary and speak more confidently. The goal is for users to feel like they’re improving every day without feeling pressured — learning a language should be a journey they enjoy, not a chore they dread.
